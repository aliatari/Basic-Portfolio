<p>Hello! I'm Ali, I'm a web developer with a background in product management and digital marketing.
    <br>
     Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, I spend as much time giving back to my community as possible.
     <br>
     You can expect to find me working at one of our various film festivals around town, or you might bump
     <br>
     into me lending a helping hand at one of the countless charity runs around the Northwest region. 
     <br>
     When I'm not working I'm out slaying concrete, running has always been and will continue to be a major interest of mine.
     <br>
     I've finished 6 full marathons, 13 halfs, and too many other races to count. Not stopping till I qualify for Boston, 
     <br>
     and even after that I'll keep going strong!
